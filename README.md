# VibeWiz Markdown Viewer

Beautiful local web renderer for Markdown files generated by your cost-analysis skills.

## What it reads

- `.claude/skills/**/*.md`
- `cost/**/*.md` (when this folder exists)

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:4173
```

## Features

- Sidebar with searchable file list
- Styled Markdown rendering (tables, code blocks, lists, headings, links)
- Table of contents generated from headings
- File metadata: last updated time and size
- Mobile + desktop responsive layout

## Notes

- The frontend uses CDN scripts for `marked`, `DOMPurify`, and `highlight.js`.
- If you need fully offline mode, we can vendor these libraries locally in a follow-up.
